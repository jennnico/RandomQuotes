# RandomQuotes

• HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and Javascript.

• Math.random is used to generate a random number (0-5). Random number is used to find the indices of the quote and color arrays. Each array has a length of 6.

• When user clicks "New Quote," one of six random quotes will appear and with corresponding background color.

• Page includes links to Tumblr and Twitter.

Areas for improvement:

• Provide more possible quotes by using a database or another website, in place of an array.
